# AWS Cloud & Cybersecurity Portfolio

This portfolio showcases my hands-on labs and projects as I prepare for AWS Cloud Practitioner and cybersecurity certifications.

Inside, you’ll find:

- AWS IAM setups and policies  
- EC2 instance configurations  
- S3 bucket security  
- VPC networking basics  
- Security+ study notes and practice labs  

I’m building practical skills to launch a career in cloud security and cybersecurity analysis.

This is not easy...
